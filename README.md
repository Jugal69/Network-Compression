# Network-Compression
Compression of CNN Network using SVD

1) Trained a CNN network on MNIST dataset & stored all the weight matrices in numpy files.
2) Developed a new CNN architecture for the same dataset & used the singular value decomposed matrices of the stored weights in reduced dimension as the new weights of the network.
3) Compared the accuracy of the networks which use weights of varying dimension derived from the stored weights.
4) Tools/Technologies used : Python,Tensorflow
